Now read this very carefully.
I shall write this only once.

The appsettings.Development.json and appsettings.Production.json are only included
to provide a fully functional demo of external logins.
IF you'd use this template for your project, be VERY, VERY sure to modify the gitignore file.
Uncomment the appsettings.*.json to prevent your precious OAuth Client-ids and Client-secrets
from ending up in your source control.

The OAuth client credentials in this project are generated with a useless account.
They have absolutely no meaning at all in the real world.
